  The human wins if it is in and the majority votes to end the game, or if it remains in by the time there are 3 contestants remaining. The AIs that remain win if the human is voted out, but if an AI is voted out, that AI loses regardless.
  
  The game is played in rounds. At the end of each round, the players vote for who they think is the human. Whichever player has the most votes is eliminated.`,

    Analyze the conversation and determine who should speak next based on:
    1. If someone was directly asked a question, they should respond
    2. If someone hasn't spoken in a while, they should get a turn
    3. If the conversation is general, pick someone who hasn't spoken recently
    4. If multiple people haven't spoken recently, pick one randomly
    
    Return a JSON object with:
